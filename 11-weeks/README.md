## Features

This watchface is inspired by one of my favourite Pebble watchface '11 Weeks', which can be found in the Rebble Store [here](https://store-beta.rebble.io/app/5659ab0bc3a3a5e072000081) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/programus/pebble-watchface-11weeks).

The design integrates a time display and a calendar into a single grid.

This layout provides a comprehensive view of time and personal metrics in a compact and visually appealing format.

  - Highlight for the current day
